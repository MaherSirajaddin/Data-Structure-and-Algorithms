The application is utilizing Cnovlutional Deep Neural Networks and image-processing methods using OpenCV library designed and modified to the needs of road traffic analysis. This method gives functional capabilities of the system to monitor the road, to initiate automated vehicle tracking, to measure the average speed. This system is based on stationary video cameras

This software was made to save users time so that they donâ€™t get stuck in traffic jams and avoid them beforehand as they have prior knowledge about the traffic conditions on the alternate routes, so that users could choose the route with least traffic and hence shall reach his/her destination hassle free. What users need to do is, subscribe to the routes (from their android phone) in a particular area, our software will tell the user about the traffic density in each of the alternate routes available in that area and suggest the best route with least traffic to the user
